                Tourism in India is important for the country's economy and is growing rapidly. The World Travel and
                Tourism
                Council calculated that tourism generated ₹13.2 lakh crore (US$170 billion) or 5.8% of India's GDP and
                supported 32.1 million jobs in 2021. Even though, these numbers were lower than the pre-pandemic
                figures;
                the country's economy witnessed a significant growth in 2021 after the massive downturn during 2020. The
                sector is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 7.8% to ₹33.8 lakh crore (US$420 billion) by 2031 (7.2%
                of
                GDP).[1] In October 2015, India's medical tourism sector was estimated to be worth US$3 billion, and it
                is
                projected to grow to US$7–8 billion by 2020.[2] In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients travelled to India to
                seek
                medical treatment.[3] Over 17.9 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2019 compared to 17.4
                million
                in 2018, representing a growth of 3.5%.[4] This makes India the 22nd most visited nation in the world
                and
                8th in Asia and Pacific .[5] Domestic tourist visits to all states and union territories numbered
                1,036.35
                million in 2012, an increase of 16.5% from 2011.[6] In 2014, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh
                were
                the most popular states for tourists.[7] Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Agra and Jaipur were the five most
                visited
                cities of India by foreign tourists during the year 2015. Worldwide, Delhi is ranked 28th by the number
                of
                foreign tourist arrivals, while Mumbai is ranked 30th, Chennai 43rd, Agra 45th, Jaipur 52nd and Kolkata
                90th.[8]

                The World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Development Index 2021, which replaced its previous Travel
                and
                Tourism Competitiveness Report, ranks India 54th out of 117 countries overall.[9] The last edition of
                the
                Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report, published in 2019, had ranked India 34th out of 140 countries
                overall. The report ranked the price competitiveness of India's tourism sector 13th out of 140
                countries. It
                mentioned that India has quite good air transport infrastructure (ranked 33rd), particularly given the
                country's stage of development, and reasonable ground and port infrastructure (ranked 28th). The country
                also scored high on natural resources (ranked 14th), and cultural resources and business travel (ranked
                8th).[10] The World Tourism Organization reported that India's receipts from tourism during 2012 ranked
                16th
                in the world, and 7th among Asian and Pacific countries.[11]

                    India requires citizens of most countries to hold a valid passport and apply for a travel visa at
                    their local Indian embassy or consulate before their visit. Travellers can apply directly by mail or
                    in person, or through their local travel services company. In 2014, India implemented an online
                    method for citizens of 156 countries to apply for an e-Tourist Visa.
                    A Protected Area Permit (PAP) is required to enter the states of Nagaland and Sikkim and some parts
                    of the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur, Mizoram, Rajasthan
                    and Uttarakhand. A Restricted Area Permit (RAP) is required to enter the Andaman and Nicobar Islands
                    and parts of Sikkim. Special permits are needed to visit the Lakshadweep islands

                    As a measure to boost tourism,[18] the Indian Government implemented a new visa policy in November
                    2014, allowing tourists and business visitors to obtain a "visa on arrival" at 28 international
                    airports, by acquiring an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) online before arrival, without
                    having to visit an Indian consulate or visa centre.[19] In April 2015, the "visa on arrival" scheme
                    was renamed "e-Tourist Visa" (or "e-TV") to avoid confusion.[20]

                    The e-Tourist Visa facility requires a tourist to apply online on a secure Government of India
                    website, at least four to thirty days before the date of travel. If approved, the visitor must print
                    and carry the approved visa with their travel documents. The visa allows holders of an ETA to enter
                    and stay anywhere in India for a period of ninety days except for citizens of US, UK, Japan and
                    Canada. Citizens of these countries can stay for up to 180 days at a time.[21] an ETA can be
                    obtained twice in a single calendar year. </p>
